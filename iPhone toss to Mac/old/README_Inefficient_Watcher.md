# Inefficient Watcher

## Overview
`inefficientwatcher.py` is a Python script that continuously monitors a specified directory for new `.txt` files, converts them based on their content, and opens them with PyCharm. The script also logs its monitoring activities.

## Features
- **File Monitoring**: Continuously monitors a specified directory for new `.txt` files.
- **File Conversion**: Extracts file extensions from the first line of `.txt` files and renames them accordingly.
- **Execution with PyCharm**: Renamed files are opened with PyCharm for execution.
- **Logging**: Logs monitoring activity to a file in the specified directory.
- **Error Handling**: Handles permission errors and other exceptions during file processing.

## Usage
1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2. **Run the Script**:
    ```bash
    python inefficientwatcher.py
    ```

3. **Interact with the Script**:
   - The script will start monitoring the specified directory for new `.txt` files.
   - When a new `.txt` file is detected, the script will extract the extension, rename the file, and open it with PyCharm.
   - Monitoring activities will be logged to `watching2.txt` in the specified directory.

## Example
```bash
$ python inefficientwatcher.py
Starting to monitor directory: /Users/puppuccino/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/PyCharmTransfer
Logging monitoring activity...
Processing file: /Users/puppuccino/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/PyCharmTransfer/example.txt
First line of the file: # Example.py
Extracted extension: py, marker: #
Renaming file from: /Users/puppuccino/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/PyCharmTransfer/example.txt to: /Users/puppuccino/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/PyCharmTransfer/torun/example.py
File renamed to: /Users/puppuccino/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/PyCharmTransfer/torun/example.py using marker: #
Calling PyCharm to run the script: /Users/puppuccino/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/PyCharmTransfer/torun/example.py
Waiting for 30 seconds before the next scan...
```

## Configuration
- **path_to_watch**: Set the path to the directory containing the `.txt` files to be monitored. Modify the `path_to_watch` variable in the script as needed.

## Future Expansion Plans
1. **Enhanced Pattern Matching**: Improve the pattern matching to handle different types of file structures.
2. **Customization Options**: Allow users to customize the marker detection and file handling process.
3. **Recursive Directory Monitoring**: Extend the script to monitor files in subdirectories.
4. **Advanced Logging**: Implement detailed logging to track processed files and any errors.
